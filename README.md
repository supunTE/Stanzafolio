# Stanzafolio

Welcome to Stanzafolio, my 3D room-themed portfolio website.

According to Farrell's ["From Portafoglio to Eportfolio: The Evolution of Portfolio in Higher Education"](https://jime.open.ac.uk/articles/10.5334/jime.574) article:

> The word portfolioâ€™s etymology derives from the Italian word portafoglio. This was a case or folder for carrying loose papers or pictures. Porta means to carry and folio means loose sheet of paper (Oxford English Dictionary 2006; Lam 2018)

The name "Stanzafolio" is a fusion of "stanza" (Italian for "room") and "folio" (representing a container of papers/data).

The 3D scene is created using React Three Fiber, a ReactJs wrapper for ThreeJS. The interface was developed with ReactJs and various other technologies.

ðŸš§ This website is still under development and will continue to evolve further.
